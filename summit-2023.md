# Machines Reading Maps Summit!
## At the David Rumsey Map Center and CESTA at Stanford University
## April 20-21, 2023

### Thursday 9AM-12PM Demo for Developers and Stakeholders (Invitation only)
David Rumsey Map Center, Stanford Libaries (refreshments will be served in the Bender Room)
This session will introduce different components of the work to potential future stakeholders and developer community members who are interested in re-using these tools in other map collections or for research applications across collections.

- #### 9:00 - 10:00
- Chair: TBD
   - Introduction by David Rumsey
   - Demo of search & annotation by Valeria Vitale & David Wong
   - Why does this matter? by Stace Maples
   - A history of the project by Katie McDonough

Break - refreshments will be served in the Bender Room at Stanford Libraries

#### 10:30 - 12:00
Chair: TBD
  System and pipeline / Codebase Briefing (Yao-yi)
  Annotations (Rainer + Valeria on value of annotations)
  Implementing Search
  Next Steps (Community, Generalization, etc…)

Lunch

### Thursday 1PM-4PM Public Presentation of Machines Reading Maps 
David Rumsey Map Center, Stanford Libaries
This conference, intended for future users, will address the methods behind the data creation and UX as well as the impact the new search and data access will have on research.

#### Panel 1, From Maps to Data and Back Again
Chair: TBD
[10 min] David Rumsey intro
[20 min] Jina Kim, “The mapKurator System: Extracting and Linking Text from Large Numbers of Historical Map Scans”
[15 min] Drake Zabriskie and David Wong, “LUNA Annotation Search and Display”
[15 min] Rainer Simon, "Map Annotation Overlay and Crowdsourced Corrections with Annotorious & LUNA"
[10 min] Valeria Vitale, “Discovering and enriching maps through their text”
[20 min] Katie McDonough, “Using Text on Maps for Research” 

Break - refreshments will be served in the Bender Room at Stanford Libraries

#### Panel 2, Text on Maps: What does it mean for research?
Chair: TBD
5-10 min from each panelist, followed by discussion with audience



### Friday 9AM-12PM Building a Developer Community (Invitation only)
### David Rumsey Map Center, Stanford Libaries
The purpose of this session is to identify opportunities and friction points while sketching out the future of an open source project building on the foundations of Machines Reading Maps.

Shape and priorities of the initiative going forward
Generalizing the pipeline
Documentation for mapKurator and Annotorious (+ future search code?)
Futures and priorities for different use cases 
Batch processing vs one-off/small scale
How does this become possible for institutions with capacity for development/implementation vs those that do not
How do we integrate into existing systems for text search?
What is the relationship between map text datasets and collection/item metadata?
Using the data in computational research (e.g. using search as pathway to research applications) - facilitating export from library systems or storing versioned data in accessible places
Licensing/what does community look like around project 
Community overlaps. Leveraging existing efforts. (GeoBlacklight, IIIF, etc…)

Opportunities and Friction Points To Date
Focus on IIIF as endpoint for computational access? Or other infrastructures?
Multilingual issues, and other collection-specific needs
Creating feedback loops for model outputs to training data (how to use annotations from a ML perspective)
Building community around models and datasets as they are created and enriched
Working with institutions that all have different systems
is scope ONLY text, or also other map features (linked to text)



### Friday 1PM-4PM Building the User Community: Workshop for students and faculty and staff (Registration required)
### Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis, Conference Room
Workshop led by MRM team members to introduce key features of the Rumsey search and annotation interfaces, with some additional detail about the underlying dataset generated by mapKurator. 


To make the most of the workshop:

Bring laptop
Some familiarity with jupyter notebooks helpful, but not required
