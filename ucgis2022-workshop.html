    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This workshop will introduce and familiarize participants with the latest ready-to-use machine learning and web-based annotation tools for efficiently extracting textual information on historical maps, linking the texts to external knowledge bases, and exporting the linked information.
        These combined tools help historians, geographers, and librarians to quickly generate useful information from existing digital map collections (e.g., USGS historical topographic maps, the David Rumsey Historical Map collection, historical Ordnance Survey maps).
        <br><br>
        In particular, we will use the web-based annotation platform, Recogito, integrated with our latest machine learning tool, mapKurator, developed within the <a href="https://machines-reading-maps.github.io/">Machines Reading Maps</a> project.
        Our team is actively designing and developing automatic approaches to enrich information and leverage the value of text on maps, which includes predicting semantic types of places and generating geospatial linked data.
        We aim to understand and identify any issues and bottlenecks of automatic approaches and create an important communication channel between tool developers and a broad community that uses historical maps, including all users and re-users of the data and metadata we produce.
        We will provide a set of historical maps and tutorials for hands-on learning. Participants are also encouraged to bring their own maps.
